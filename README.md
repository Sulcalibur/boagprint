#Boagworld Print Style
---

### Print style sheet for Paul Boag's Boagworld version 4 web site.

[http://twitter.com/boagworld](Paul Boag) asked the community if anyone could help with his redesign of his incredibly popular web site regarding web site development and design. I jumped at the chance as was asked by Paul if I could style the print version to have a similar look and feel to services such as [http://instapaper.com](Instapaper), [http://readability.com](Readability) and [http://getpocket.com](Pocket).

This is the result. Not as familiar to Print style CSS as the usual varying screen sizes CSS it was challenge to get it working as well I wanted. Some features I am still having problems with such as a consistent footer, but other than that it seems to be pretty good.

I'm not too keen on people wasting paper, but if it is essential than this style should not only save paper but also make it look pretty tasty.

If there is anything that you think would make this look better then by all means please fork it and work your magic. Full credit will be included.

Thanks :)
